## Experience

## Education
I have recently completed my final semester of Computer Science and Engineering, Bachelors of Technology from [Indian Institute of Technology, (BHU) Varanasi](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in). I'm department rank 2 with a CPI of 9.77. My research paper was published as part of my exploratory project under [Dr. K.K. Shukla.](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=M72zMtAAAAAJ&hl=en).
<br><br>
I'm currently working on my Bachelor's research paper under [Dr. S.K. Singh](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=LCD74DIAAAAJ&hl=en). I am additionally working under the supervision of [Dr. Vignesh Sivaraman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=uneJnlUAAAAJ&hl=en) on GAN-based synthetic data generation for multi-domain joint distribution datasets. If you want to collaborate or are interested in the field, please feel free to reach out. 

## About me
I learnt programming from mostly my friends and I am always keen on returning the favour. Those moments have made for the fondest of my college memories.
<br>
I am still figuring out what I want to do and I hope I never feel it's too late to think like that.
