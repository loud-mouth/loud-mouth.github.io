Notes

### If GemFile is included, Bundler will install all those gems that are listed in the GemFile

```
bundle install

bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### Liquid 

Like thymeleaf, liquid supports variables (called Objects `{{`, `}}`), conditional statements (called [Tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/) `{%`, `%}`) and options (called [Filters](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/), `|`).
