# Hi, I'm Anant Saxena.

I'm a final year CS undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology, (BHU) Varanasi](https://iitbhu.ac.in/). I'm a backend dev who likes building customer-facing products that scale super good [(just like this.)](https://github.com/anantsxna/redis-rdb-compare)

<!-- add a paragraph break -->

I enjoy research into Optimization Algorithms and how to make them stronger/better/faster, and I presented my research [at GECCO '22, Boston, MA](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3512290.3528877). In general, I like puzzle-solving and competitive progamming.

Since COVID times, I've felt compelled to learn about the market and trading during my free time. Being a part-time consultant with [WorldQuant](https://www.worldquant.com/) helps with that. I also have a keen interest in storytelling and love to study the art of joke-telling. When I'm not coding, reading or trading, I like to draw doodles and spend time with my family back in East Delhi.
